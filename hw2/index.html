		<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this assignment, we implemented foundational graphics algorithms including triangle mesh editing, Bezier curve and surface evaluation, area-weighted vertex normals, edge flips and splits, and Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling. Building these components gave us a hands-on understanding of how geometric data structures and algorithms work together to create and manipulate 3D objects.<br><br>
Personally, we found it fascinating to learn the basics of graphics like triangle meshes and Bezier curves, especially since we are interested in computer vision for robotics. Object rendering and mesh manipulation are directly relevant for determining viable robot grasp poses, and understanding the nuances of mesh subdivision and its effects on rendering provides valuable insight for such applications.<br><br>
We also discovered something new about Bezier curves: the entire curve (or surface) is parametrized by t, u, and v, rather than fitting a cubic curve or surface to a single point. This deeper understanding of parametric curves and surfaces will be useful for both graphics and robotics contexts. Overall, this assignment helped us appreciate the interplay between mathematical theory and practical implementation in computer graphics.</p>

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>


<p><b>de Casteljau’s algorithm</b> is a recursive method for evaluating Bezier curves. At each step, it linearly interpolates between consecutive control points using a parameter <i>t</i>, producing a new set of points. This process repeats until only one point remains, which is the point on the Bezier curve for the given <i>t</i>. We implemented this by iteratively computing intermediate points for each level, visualizing each step, and finally obtaining the curve point.</p>

		<h4>Step-by-step evaluation of a Bezier curve (original control points)</h4>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p><b>de Casteljau’s algorithm</b> can be extended from curves to surfaces by applying the 1D algorithm twice: once along one parameter direction (u), and then along the other (v). For a Bezier surface patch, we first perform de Casteljau’s algorithm on each row of control points for a fixed u, producing a new set of points. Then, we apply the algorithm again on the resulting points along the columns for a fixed v, yielding the final evaluated point on the surface. We implemented this by iteratively evaluating along both directions, visualizing the process, and rendering the surface.</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
<p>To compute an approximate unit normal at a vertex, we implemented area-weighted vertex normals by iterating over all faces adjacent to the vertex. For each face, we calculate its normal and multiply it by the triangle's area, then sum these vectors. Finally, we normalize the result to obtain the vertex normal. This produces smoother shading compared to flat shading, as the normal is influenced more by larger adjacent faces.</p>
		<pre><code>// For each adjacent face:
normal_sum += area * face_normal;
// Normalize the result:
return normal_sum / norm;
</code></pre>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
<p>The edge flip operation locally modifies the mesh by replacing an edge shared by two triangles with the other diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by those triangles. To implement this, we carefully reassigned the neighbors of all involved half-edges, vertices, faces, and edges, ensuring the mesh connectivity was updated correctly. Special care was taken to handle boundary cases and to update the twin half-edges for the outer edges of the affected triangles.</p>
		<h4>Teapot before and after edge flips</h4>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  <figcaption>Before edge flips</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td>
				  <img src="images/4/flipped.png" width="350px"/>
				  <figcaption>After edge flips</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<h4>Debugging journey</h4>
<p>Debugging the edge flip was eventful! The most useful technique was redrawing a diagram of the baseline edge-flip case, thoroughly labeling all half-edges, edges, vertices, and faces, and then following the logic in our code step by step. One tricky bug was forgetting to reset the neighbors of the twin half-edges for the outer edges of the relevant triangle faces, which led to broken mesh connectivity. By visualizing the mesh and methodically checking each pointer assignment, we were able to identify and fix the issue.</p>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
<p>The edge split operation inserts a new vertex at the midpoint of an edge and rewires the surrounding mesh to create four new edges and two new faces. We implemented this by creating new mesh elements and carefully updating all half-edge, edge, vertex, and face pointers. Special attention was needed to ensure the original edge was split into four separate edges, not just two, to maintain correct mesh connectivity.</p>
		<h4>Mesh before and after edge splits</h4>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<h4>Mesh after both edge splits and edge flips</h4>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				</td>
				<td>
				  <img src="images/5/split_flipped.png" width="350px"/>
				  <figcaption>After edge splits and flips</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<h4>Debugging journey</h4>
<p>Debugging edge splits was a real adventure! Like with edge flips, we started by drawing detailed diagrams and labeling every half-edge, edge, vertex, and face involved in the operation. The most pernicious bug we encountered was not fully splitting the middle edge itself. Instead of creating four separate edges from the original, our code was only producing two, which led to mesh connectivity issues that only became apparent when we tried to split the same region multiple times. The mesh would look fine after one split, but subsequent splits would break the structure in subtle ways.<br><br>
To track down the problem, we carefully traced through our pointer assignments and compared our diagram to the actual mesh after each operation. We realized that we needed to create and wire up four distinct edges, not just two, and update all the associated half-edges and faces accordingly. Once we made this change, the mesh behaved correctly even after repeated splits.</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
<p>Loop subdivision is an algorithm for mesh upsampling that increases the number of triangles while producing a smoother surface. Our implementation follows these main steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Vertex update:</b> Compute new positions for all original vertices using the Loop subdivision rule, which weights the vertex and its neighbors. Mark each vertex as old.</li>
			<li><b>Edge update:</b> Compute new positions for all edges using a weighted average of the edge endpoints and their opposite vertices.</li>
			<li><b>Edge split:</b> Split every edge in the original mesh, creating new vertices at the computed edge positions and marking new edges/vertices appropriately.</li>
			<li><b>Edge flip:</b> Flip any new edge that connects an old and new vertex to improve mesh regularity.</li>
			<li><b>Position update:</b> Copy the new vertex positions into the final mesh.</li>
		</ol>
<p>One interesting debugging challenge was ensuring that only the original edges were split in step 3. If new edges created during subdivision were also split, the process would never terminate and the mesh would become corrupted. To avoid this, we tracked which edges were new and only split the original ones. Another tricky part was correctly updating the positions and flags for new and old vertices and edges, as missing these details could lead to artifacts or mesh connectivity issues. Careful use of diagrams and step-by-step pointer tracing was essential for getting the algorithm right.</p>
		<h4>Observations on mesh behavior after Loop subdivision</h4>
<p>After applying Loop subdivision, we observed that sharp corners and edges tend to become smoother and more rounded. This is because the subdivision algorithm averages vertex positions, which naturally softens features. However, by pre-splitting edges and making the triangle mesh denser near sharp corners and edges, we were able to reduce this smoothing effect and better preserve sharp features. Increasing mesh density in these regions gives the subdivision algorithm more control points to work with, helping maintain the original shape.</p>

		<h4>Cube symmetry and pre-processing for Loop subdivision</h4>
<p>When performing several iterations of Loop subdivision on a cube, we noticed that the cube gradually becomes slightly asymmetric. This happens because the initial triangulation of the cube's faces is not perfectly symmetric—each face is split with a single diagonal, so the subdivision process propagates this asymmetry and exaggerates it with each iteration. The images below show <b>cubea.png</b> (the original cube with a single diagonal per face) and the results of repeated subdivision without any pre-processing:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td><img src="images/6/cubea.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>cubea.png: Original cube (single diagonal per face)</figcaption></td>
				<td><img src="images/6/cube1a.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>1st subdivision</figcaption></td>
				<td><img src="images/6/cube2a.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>2nd subdivision</figcaption></td>
				<td><img src="images/6/cube3a.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>3rd subdivision</figcaption></td>
				<td><img src="images/6/cube4a.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>4th subdivision</figcaption></td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
<p>To address this, we pre-processed the cube by splitting each face with two diagonals (forming an X), which made the triangulation symmetric. The image <b>cubeb.png</b> shows the original cube with this pre-processing. After this, repeated Loop subdivision produced much more symmetric results, as shown below:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td><img src="images/6/cubeb.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>cubeb.png: Cube with pre-split faces (X on each face)</figcaption></td>
				<td><img src="images/6/cube1b.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>1st subdivision (symmetric)</figcaption></td>
				<td><img src="images/6/cube2b.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>2nd subdivision (symmetric)</figcaption></td>
				<td><img src="images/6/cube3b.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>3rd subdivision (symmetric)</figcaption></td>
				<td><img src="images/6/cube4b.png" width="180px"/><figcaption>4th subdivision (symmetric)</figcaption></td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>This effect occurs because Loop subdivision averages vertex positions based on the local mesh connectivity. If the connectivity is asymmetric, the averaging process will introduce and amplify asymmetries. By pre-splitting and flipping edges to make the mesh connectivity symmetric, the subdivision process preserves the cube's symmetry through multiple iterations. This demonstrates the importance of mesh pre-processing for controlling the outcome of subdivision algorithms.</p>
